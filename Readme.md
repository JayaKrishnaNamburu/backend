Revisiting my backend and psql (rdbms) skills after 3+ years. Trying to learn and implement stuff in a much polished way
than i used to do earlier. There might be a lot of things that can be improved, but this is something which i am
completly learning and developing from scratch.

Topics to learn and implement

- [ ] Request checks
- [ ] Logging requests
- [ ] Entity Definitions
- [ ] Migrations
- [ ] Entity Associations
- [ ] Indexing
- [ ] Transactions
- [ ] Cron Jobs
- [ ] Triggers and Hooks
